## About
***The InstaStoryView is a custom Android library which is hosted on ***Jitpack***. This library allows user to easily use the Instagram-Story like features in their Android Applications. All you need to do is add ImageURLs, ProfileURL and what you will get is a progressive and interactive story view in which you can pause a progressive story and move forwards or backwards.***

## Installation:
- Step 1. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```
- Step 2. Add the dependency:
```
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.SiddyDevelops:InstaStoryView:1.0.0'
	}
```

## Usage:
- The very first step is to include ``<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`` in the ``AndroidManifest.xml`` of your project.

- In order to use the functionality of this library you need to create your own RecyclerView-Adapters and Viewholders which will inflate the StoryViewer. So all the code/modifications are needed to be done inside the RecyclerViewAdapter.

</p>

- Once you have created you ``StoryViewRV`` (which on clicking will display the story) we can add the functionality of this library. Lets us take the given below RV as an example:

</p>

- Inside the ``StoryViewAdapter`` you need to initilize the ``InstaStoryViewer`` in the ``onBindViewHolder`` function.

	```
	@Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull StoryViewHolder holder, int position) {
        ..
        ..
        holder.itemview.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                    InstaStoryViewer instaStoryViewer = new InstaStoryViewer(view.getContext(),MainActivity.class,ImageURls,
		                                             username,userProfile,storyTimes,likeCounts,storyText);
                    instaStoryViewer.showStory();      // To inflate the StoryView onClick.
            }
        });
    }
	```

***InstaStoryViewer Constructor Structure:***
	
```
InstaStoryViewer(Context context, Class cls, String[] imageURls, String username, String userProfile, 
                                        String[] storyTimes, String[] likeCounts, String[] storyText)  
					
	 Context     -->  Context of the activity/class from where you initiate the library.
	 Cls         -->  Class in which the Main RecyclerView is present.	
	 ImageURLs   -->  Array of all the Image URLs which are needed to be loaded into the StoryViewer.
	 Username    -->  Username which will be displayed is needed to be displayed with the image.
	 UserProfile -->  URL of the Profile Image of the user.
	 StoryTimes  -->  Array of the time of upload of story.
	 LikeCounts  -->  Array of the counts for each image in the story.
	 StoryText   -->  Array of the texts which are needed to be displayed with the story.
``` 

**NOTE:** The instagram stories have hierarchical structure, i.e., each user might have multiple images in their story hence the contructor must be change iteratratively for all the items in the recycler view otherwise you will get to see constant stories for all the users.
